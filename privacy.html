      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p><strong>Last updated: December 27, 2025</strong></p>
      <p>FreeLock ("we," "us," "our," or "Company") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application ("App").</p>

      <h3>1. Data We Collect</h3>
      <p><strong>On-Device Data:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>NFC card identifiers (stored as SHA-256 hashes only)</li>
        <li>App blocking preferences and configurations</li>
        <li>Lock schedules and settings</li>
        <li>Audit log of lock/unlock events</li>
        <li>Emergency passcode (stored as SHA-256 hash)</li>
        <li>Optional accountability contact email</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>No data collection:</strong> FreeLock does NOT collect, store, or transmit any of this data to our servers. Everything stays on your device.</p>

      <h3>2. How We Use Your Data</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>On-device processing:</strong> Your NFC card identifiers are hashed locally and compared on-device for authentication</li>
        <li><strong>Local storage:</strong> All data is stored locally in the iOS Keychain and app private storage</li>
        <li><strong>No sharing:</strong> We never share, sell, or transmit your data to third parties</li>
        <li><strong>No analytics:</strong> We do not track your app usage or behavior</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Data Security</h3>
      <p>Your data is protected by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>iOS Keychain encryption for sensitive data (tokens, passcode, contacts)</li>
        <li>SHA-256 hashing of NFC card identifiers (original values never stored)</li>
        <li>On-device only storage with no cloud backup</li>
        <li>Device-level encryption provided by iOS</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Third-Party Services</h3>
      <p><strong>Apple Screen Time API:</strong> FreeLock uses Apple's FamilyControls and ManagedSettings frameworks to block apps. Apple does not receive information about which apps you block. See <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/" target="_blank">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Accountability Notifications (Optional):</strong> If you configure an accountability contact, emergency unlock events may be sent to our notification service. This includes only:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An anonymized device identifier (hash)</li>
        <li>The event type (e.g., "emergency_unlock")</li>
        <li>Timestamp</li>
        <li>Your accountability contact's email address</li>
      </ul>
      <p>No other data is transmitted. The accountability feature is entirely optional.</p>

      <h3>5. Your Privacy Rights</h3>
      <p>Since all your data is stored on your device:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You have full control and ownership of your data</li>
        <li>You can delete tokens anytime from Settings</li>
        <li>You can export your audit log in text format</li>
        <li>You can use Emergency Delete to remove all data</li>
        <li>You can uninstall the app to remove all data</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6. Children's Privacy</h3>
      <p>FreeLock is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you are under 13, please do not use this app.</p>

      <h3>7. Changes to This Policy</h3>
